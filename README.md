#### Autumn 2020 - Deepfake Detection Challenge
Tag: Big data, Data processing, Image processing, Deep learning  
Link of competition: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge" target="_blank">this link</a>  
My notebook: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/longenie/deepfake-detection-with-cnn-model" target="_blank">this link</a>  
Description: Deepfake Detection Challenge is a featured competition, which is held to find deepfake detection techniques dealing with deepfake criminal in future - a way using deeplearning to fake other facial and voice illegally. This is an amateurs project to get used to handle big data, especially image frame. And somewhat get touch with deep learning model - CNN, Mesonet. The notebook is just a copy with available references for research and theory reporting. Our team has no rights for this contribution.

#### Autumn 2020 - Hashing Algorithms in Information Security
Tag: Information Security, Hash, sha256
Demo run in local device with private usage so as not to have any reference link for this. But chill out, details better. 
Description: SHA256 - ‚ÄúSecure Hash Algorithm 256-bit‚Äù, is one of the most common hashing algorithms, a next version of SHA-1, there are so many algorithms in SHA-family. SHA256 gives 256bit long output in 64 characters.
Our project is implement a tool to generate SHA256 from any text. This is so useful for password hashing or verify networking packages or SSL protocol (ref). This simulate use a public SHA256 ref to demo. Our work is a way more salty, it's apply salt to the SHA256 algorithms just to make "with the same text, we get different hashes", but also have to make sure those hashes always decoded into the same text at first.
The demo is hosted by Flask framework.
