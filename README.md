Description: Deepfake Detection Challenge is a featured competition, which is held to find deepfake detection techniques dealing with deepfake criminal in future - a way using deeplearning to fake other facial and voice illegally. An amateurs project to get used to handle big data, especially image frame. And somewhat get touch with deep learning model - CNN, Mesonet.
